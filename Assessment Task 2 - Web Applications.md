## Functional Requirements

- **Purpose of the Application** - The purpose of the application is to enhance the experience of a hangout with friends, whilst bringing them outdoors to reconnect with nature. This application will have a positive social impact on friend groups through an interactive "choose your own adventure" game, but with real life goals, thus bringing people together outside, allowing them to enjoy each others company in nature. 
- **Use Cases:** 
    - *Start Button* - Users will press the start button on the home page to bring them to the two paths page. 
    - *Choosing Initial Path* - Users can press on one of two buttons which, depending on what button they press, will take them to the respective path page.
    - *Previous and Next Stage Buttons* - Users can press previous or next stage buttons to go back and forth between different pages.
    - *Different Pathway Buttons* - Users can press on one of two buttons that will take them to different pages depending on what button they chose to press. 
    - *Photo Challenge Buttons* - Users can press on a button that reveals the photo challenge for their respective location. 
    - *Finish Trail Button* - Users will press the finish button when the trail has been completed.

- **Test Cases:**
    - *Start Button* - When the user presses on the start button on the home page, the web application will take the user to the two paths page. 
    - *Choosing Initial Path* - When the user presses on one of the initial paths, the web application will take the user to the resepective path page.
    - *Previous and Next Stage Buttons* - When the user presses on "previous stage" or "next stage" buttons, the web application will take the user to the previous page or to the next page of the pathway. 
    - *Different Pathway Buttons* - When the user presses on one of the different pathway buttons, the web application will take the user to a different pathway page. 
    - *Photo Challenge Buttons* - When the user presses on the "photo challenge' button, the web application will reveal a photo challenge that the user can copy with their friends in real life, as well as description of the photo. 
    - *Finish Trail Button* - When the user presses on the "finish trail" button, the web application will take the user to the final "congratulations" page.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**
     - The website will deliver smooth, seamless transitions between pages, with minimal delay and with the highest quality possible. Furthermore, buttons will work within as little time as possible, to ensure that pages will run without distruptions. 
- **Usability** - The website will include features to maximise usability such as: 
    - *Consistent Layout*: Having a consistent layout will make it easy for people to learn and navigate the contents within the website.
    - *Colours*: Good colours will not only make the website aesthetically pleasing, but will also allow the users to navigate the website easily due to the contrast between colours. 
    - *Fonts*: Having readable fonts will ensure that the contents of the website is legible and easy to read, which is needed to maximise usability.
    - *Scaling and proportions*: In my website, the different icons and images will be properly scaled in order to have even proportions so that the website will be fully usable. 
    
- **Reliability** 
    - To ensure reliability, I will make sure to run tests that are both consistent in their manner and objective. My website is aimed to be accessed on phones as it's more practical to carry a phone with you on a hike compared to a laptop or another device, so tests will be run regarding to the layout of a phone. 
- **Security** 
    - The app will not be collecting any data.

## PMI Table

| Application |    Plus     | Minus       | Implication  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------|--------------|
| Instagram   | Instagram allows individuals to communicate with other people incredibly fast and very easily. The UI and UX are both very good as messages are easy to access and the whole platform looks aesthetically pleasing. There are also a variety of ways you can communicate different media to different people and that makes it a very versatile social media platform, making communication easier for millions of people around the world. | However, Instagram, although being very easy to use, can also be addicting. On the home page, there are so many different, distracting images, videos and audios, that effectively cause people to consume large amounts of media and content over long periods of time. Furthermore, the media on instagram doesn’t have much of a filter, and you could pretty much find anything and everything on instagram, even in the comment section.  |  Instagram is a good social media platform, allowing users to communicate with other people and express themselves in a plethora of ways effectively, however, due to the large amounts of media, it’s easy for people to lose track of time on instagram, possibly getting addicted, as well as being exposed to unwanted content. In my application, I will be sure to include a very easy and accessible UI, as well as making the entire platform aesthetically pleasing, however, my application will not include any media posting features as everything will just be for the user.  |
| Spotify     | Spotify allows individuals to access free music, audiobooks and podcasts that they can listen to and enjoy. The UI and UX are extremely good as everything is organised really well and the layout of everything is really aesthetically pleasing. All the buttons and features are really consistent, making it much easier to navigate. The premium version is also really good because it allows you to access media offline, and allows you to search up songs on your phone.| However, Spotify, especially the free version, is really annoying to use. On your phone, without premium, you can only access songs through playlists, as in you can’t search up a song and just listen to it. Moreover, you only have 6 advertisement skips, and after that you’ll have to deal with double unskippable ads. But on your laptop or desktop, you can access whatever songs you want, but there are still ads, and you still can’t access them offline. | Spotify, specifically premium, is a really good application to access different types of listening media, online or offline, with good quality and no ads. However, the free version is pretty bad as you have to experience ads, and on your phone there are other limitations that come with it. In my application I will make sure that my application is free, the UI is really easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing, but will have to be online to work.       |
| Tripview    | Tripview is an app that allows individuals to plan their trip across many different ways of public transport such as trains, light rails, ferries and buses. Similar to the other apps, the UI and UX are pretty good and are also sleek, minimal and aesthetically pleasing. Moreover, the organisation of the different buttons within the app are also very good, also being colour coordinated, with good, clear, contrast between different buttons, but also possesses consistency within its UI, making it much easier to use. Furthermore, when online, tripview has real world data, meaning that you are updated on any delays that the public transport might have.  | Although tripview has a good UI and has certain features that make it easier to use, it also has a premium version, similar to spotify. The free version allows you to access the app like normal, with ads, however, it removes your search history, which makes it quite difficult to plan complex trips. Moreover, the sheer abundance of different locations you can travel can make it quite confusing for people travelling to somewhere new, as the locations don’t save.     | Tripview is a fantastic application to plan your trips, as it has vast amounts of information for different locations, however, the free version makes it really annoying and unnecessarily difficult to use, having to re-plan trips even if you use them everyday. In my application, I will make sure to include clear, concise and easily accessible and understandable information about the trip that people will go on, and I will also include proper images and apps to make it easier too. I also will ensure that my application is free and without ads.
